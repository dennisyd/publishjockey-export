# Part I: Bonds and Liberation (Slavery and the Fight for Independence)

# Born in Chains — But Not Broken

From the moment the first enslaved Africans set foot on American soil, they were in chains — but they were not broken. In **1619**, an English privateer ship brought about twenty captive Africans to the Virginia colony, inaugurating a centuries-long tragedy of bondage. These men and women had been torn from their homeland and forced across the Atlantic in the horrors of the Middle Passage, shackled in the dark holds of ships. Arriving in a strange land, they faced a new reality of servitude, treated as property rather than human beings. Yet even as iron shackles bound their bodies, their spirits resisted the complete domination their captors intended.

Life for these first Africans and those who followed was marked by unimaginable hardship. **Slave codes** soon emerged to formalize their oppression, legally defining them as chattel and ensuring that the condition of slavery would be lifelong and hereditary. By the late 1600s, colonial laws solidified a racial caste system in which Africans and their descendants were permanently enslaved. Enslavers used violence and fear to maintain control: whippings, brandings, family separations, and other cruelties were common tools to break the will of the enslaved. Despite these brutal conditions, enslaved people found ways to endure and assert their humanity. They held on to memory and hope, developing an uncanny resilience in the face of a system designed to crush them.

One of the most powerful forms of resistance was cultural survival. In secret gatherings after dark or stolen moments in the fields, enslaved Africans passed down songs, stories, and spiritual beliefs that connected them to their African roots. Through folklore and music, they preserved fragments of languages and traditions from West and Central Africa. The rhythm of a drumbeat or the cadence of a call-and-response hymn in a praise house carried echoes of lost homelands. Religion became both a refuge and a quiet act of defiance. Many enslaved people embraced a form of Christianity that spoke of deliverance and justice, finding inspiration in biblical stories of liberation like Moses leading the Israelites out of bondage. They blended Christian teachings with African spirituality, creating a faith that affirmed their dignity despite the dehumanizing world around them. By nurturing their own slave culture, distinct from that of their enslavers, they silently rejected the notion that they were merely property; they maintained identities that slavery could not erase.

Family and community ties also became an anchor of resilience. Enslaved people married in secret ceremonies—“jumping the broom” to symbolize their union—and they clung fiercely to their loved ones despite the constant threat of separation. Parents taught their children how to survive, imparting lessons through stories and songs that carried hidden messages of pride and self-respect. When owners tore families apart by selling husbands, wives, or children to distant plantations, the enslaved formed new kinship bonds: an aunt or a friend might step in as a surrogate mother for a child separated from her parents. In this way, the community created an extended family bound not just by blood but by shared hardship and hope. These bonds of love and solidarity were quiet acts of resistance, defying the enslavers’ attempts to reduce human beings to property.

Each day under slavery was a test of will, and the enslaved resisted in small but meaningful ways whenever possible. On plantations, enslaved workers slowed their pace, feigned illness, or “accidentally” broke tools as acts of everyday rebellion. These subtle tactics, often called “day-to-day resistance,” were risks that could invite punishment if discovered. But they provided a measure of agency: a way to say “no” to the endless toil and assert some control over one’s own labor, however limited. Some enslaved people cleverly sabotaged crops or machinery, quietly reminding owners that they were not content, compliant machines. Others engaged in covert learning – for instance, surreptitiously learning to read and write, despite laws forbidding it – recognizing knowledge as a pathway to freedom. Every stolen act of defiance, however small, was a declaration of a simple truth: that enslaved African Americans refused to accept that their bondage was just or permanent.

For some, resistance meant taking the ultimate risk of escape. From the colonial period onward, enslaved individuals stole away into the night in search of freedom. Many attempted to run away temporarily – hiding out in nearby woods or swamps for days or weeks – as a form of bargaining or to escape especially cruel punishment. Others launched permanent escapes, despite the terrifying odds. In the southern colonies, some runaways formed hidden communities known as **maroon** settlements. In the dense marshes of the Great Dismal Swamp or the mountains of Jamaica and the Carolinas, escapees banded together, living off the land and defending their freedom with whatever means they could. These maroon communities sometimes thrived for years, proof that self-governance and freedom were possible even under the shadow of slavery. Individual runaways also followed a variety of routes: some headed northward, while others went south toward Spanish Florida, enticed by promises of liberty. Wherever they fled, they traveled in constant fear of capture by slave patrols and bounty hunters. The decision to run was itself a testament to unbroken hope – a belief that life could be more than the condition they were born into.

When subtle forms of resistance or escape were not enough, some enslaved people chose the path of open rebellion. The colonial era witnessed a number of slave revolts that shook the foundations of the system, even if they were ultimately suppressed. As early as **1712**, a group of enslaved Africans in New York City revolted, armed with hatchets and guns; they killed several whites before the uprising was put down. The most notorious rebellion of the 18th century came in **1739** with the **Stono Rebellion** in South Carolina. On a September Sunday, about twenty slaves, led by an Angolan man called **Jemmy**, seized weapons from a country store. Carrying a banner that read “Liberty!” and beating drums, they marched south toward Florida, hoping to reach Spanish territory where freedom was promised to escaped British slaves. Along the way, they recruited fellow slaves and killed several slaveholding whites, burning houses as they went. The rebellion was crushed by the colonial militia after a fierce battle that left many rebels dead. In the aftermath, the terrified South Carolina legislature imposed even harsher laws on enslaved people, including tighter controls on their movement, assembly, and education. News of revolts like Stono traveled far and wide, spreading both hope and fear. For enslaved people, these rebellions were a spark of inspiration that even the mightiest chains could be shattered, while for slaveholders they were a nightmare that had to be quelled at all costs.

Reprisals against open resistance were brutal. After each rebellion, colonies enacted stricter slave codes, hoping to prevent the next uprising. Conspiracies, whether real or imagined, often led to horrific punishments: in the wake of a rumored plot in New York in 1741, authorities executed over thirty Black people by hanging or burning at the stake, terrorizing the Black population to discourage further resistance. Such ruthless responses underscored the enslavers’ deep fear of the people they held in bondage. Paradoxically, this fear acknowledged the enslaved as thinking, feeling people capable of yearning for freedom – the very humanity the slave system tried to deny. Every revolt, even if it failed to end slavery, forced white society to confront the lies at the heart of the system: that enslaved Africans were content or submissive. In truth, they were constantly pushing back, and the harsher the oppression grew, the more creative and determined their resistance became.

By the mid-18th century, on the eve of the American Revolution, hundreds of thousands of people of African descent were enslaved in the American colonies – about one-fifth of the population. They had been born in chains, generation after generation inheriting the status of enslaved laborers on tobacco, rice, and indigo plantations from Maryland to Georgia. But none of those generations were ever truly broken. Through covert resistance and the resilience of their communities, they kept alive an unquenchable desire for liberty. The hypocrisy of a burgeoning American nation demanding freedom from British tyranny while keeping Black people in bondage was becoming increasingly glaring. Enslaved African Americans heard the rising cry of “liberty” among white colonists and many asked, “Does this freedom not belong to us, too?”

Indeed, by the dawn of the Revolution, some Black Americans were already making the ultimate sacrifice for the cause of liberty. In March **1770**, **Crispus Attucks** – a dockworker of African and Native ancestry – was shot and killed by British soldiers in the Boston Massacre, becoming one of the first martyrs of the American Revolution. His blood spilled on the cobblestones of Boston alongside that of white colonists, symbolizing both the hope and the bitter irony of the freedom struggle. Attucks died for the promise of American liberty even as that promise was denied to millions of his people. The stage was set: a war for independence was about to begin, and with it, a new chapter in the struggle for Black freedom.
